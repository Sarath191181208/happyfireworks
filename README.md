# Happy fireworks

This is just a beautiful simulaiton of what I call fireworks.
This is nothing more than a visual treat.

- We are creating firework object and updating in every frame.
- Firework object itself handles all the shape and rendering.
- The simulation of the shapes is done using **parametric equations**
- And after every cycle, we are checking if the firework is still alive or not.
- If not alive we remove reference to it from the list.
